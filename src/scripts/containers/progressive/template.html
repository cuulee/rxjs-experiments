<div class="container page-progressive">
  <ol class="breadcrumb" style="margin-top: 20px;">
    <li class="active">Progressive</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I took advantage of this project to add some progressive app related features such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#/progressive/cache">Offline cache support via Service Worker & Appcache</a></li>
    <li><a href="#/progressive/notifications">Notifications</a></li>
    <li><a href="#/progressive/homescreen">Add to homescreen</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Those features are built on top of Offline Plugin for Webpack, to take advantage of the integration with my build workflow, more infos in the <a href="https://github.com/topheman/rxjs-experiments/wiki">dedicated WIKI section</a>.</p>
