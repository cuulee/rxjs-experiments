RxJS Experiments
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/topheman/rxjs-experiments.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/topheman/rxjs-experiments)

Based on the boilerplate [topheman/webpack-babel-starter](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter) (more there about the dev workflow).

###Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/topheman/rxjs-experiments.git
cd rxjs-experiments
npm install
```

###Run

```shell
npm start
```

Goto [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

If you need to access from a remote device (such as a smartphone on the same network), just `LOCALHOST=false npm start` and your site will be accessible via your IP (which will be output on the terminal at launch).

###Build

The `./build` directory is ignored by git, it will contain a `dist` directory which holds the distribution version of your website (the one that you will [ship once built](#deploy)).

All the build tasks will create a built version of the project in the `./build/dist` folder, cleaning it before making the build.

* `npm run build`
* `npm run build-prod` optimized / uglified version
* `npm run build-prod-all` will build:
	* production version (optimized / uglified)
	* a debuggable version accessible at `/devtools` shipping all the sourcemaps, to ease sharing transpiled source code

`npm run serve-dist` will serve your `./build/dist` folder at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) so that you could test the built version you just made.

###Linter

* eslint is running while you're developping, check your console for errors
* you can also launch it via `npm run lint`
* see `.eslintrc` for the configuration (currently, this project uses [the airbnb presets](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/eslint-config-airbnb-v5.0.1/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) - if you find it to restrictive, just remove `"extends": "airbnb/base"` in the `.eslintrc`)

###Customizations

You can customize the behavior of the scripts by specifying environments vars:

* `NODE_ENV` by default at `development`, `NODE_ENV=production` when you `npm run build-prod`
* `LINTER=false` will disable the linter (enabled by default, ex: `LINTER=false npm start`)
* `STATS=true` will write `stats.json` profiling file on disk from webpack at build (disabled by default, ex: `STATS=true npm run build`)
* `FAIL_ON_ERROR=true` will break the build if any errors occurs (useful for CIs such ase Travis - at `false` in dev-server, at `true` when building)
* `LOCALHOST=false` to access via IP from other devices on the same network (ex: `LOCALHOST=false npm start` - default `true`)
* `DEVTOOLS`: By default at `null`. Used internally in `npm run build-prod-all` (you may not need that if you don't do OSS)

###FAQ / Deploy

See the [topheman/webpack-babel-starter](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter)'s FAQ:

* deploy on github pages - [see wiki](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/wiki#deploy)
